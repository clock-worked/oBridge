## oBridge - An Obsidian plugin
 
A tool for automatically creating links between notes to bridge them together.

### Features


- **Scan Vault**: Clicking on the bridge icon in the ribbon menu scans your vault, and looks for matches between content and filenames / aliases. If a match is found, a new link in the note is created automatically, and your notes are bridged.

- **Excluded Files or Folders from oBridge**: Don't want oBridge to link every file or folder? You can exclude files or folder from your *scan* to avoid linking this that you don't want to link.
